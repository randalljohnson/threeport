// This file holds the helpers for writing GORM hooks that stay
// correct across the two call shapes GORM supports. The asymmetry
// between the call shapes is easy to miss, so this block explains the
// mental model in full and the per-function docstrings stay focused on
// what each helper does.
//
// "Hook receiver" here means the *T receiver of the GORM lifecycle
// hook methods (BeforeCreate, BeforeUpdate, BeforeDelete, AfterCreate,
// AfterUpdate, AfterDelete) that the SDK generates on every API type
// into *_validate_gen.go files. GORM calls them automatically when a
// row is being created, updated, or deleted.
//
// The update hooks fire under two call shapes (Updates and Save), and
// the receiver means a different thing in each.
//
// The mental model starts with the generated client functions (T
// stands in for any API type). In the hook column, * stands for both
// the Before and After hook, so *Create means BeforeCreate and
// AfterCreate. The shape column is the receiver layout a hook sees:
// full when the whole object is present (Model == Dest), partial when
// it is a sparse patch over the loaded row (Model != Dest). Note the
// DELETE row: for reconciled types its first GORM call is Updates,
// like PATCH, but the operation later ends in a soft Delete that fires
// the Delete hooks (detailed below the table).
//
//	client   | HTTP   | GORM     | hook     | shape    | effect
//	---------|--------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------------
//	CreateT  | POST   | Create   | *Create  | full     | inserts row
//	ReplaceT | PUT    | Save     | *Update  | full     | writes every column
//	UpdateT  | PATCH  | Updates  | *Update  | partial  | writes only sent fields
//	DeleteT  | DELETE | Updates, | *Update, | partial, | schedules deletion,
//	         |        | Delete   | *Delete  | full     | sets deleted_at
//
// Generated handlers pick the call shape from the HTTP method. The
// UpdateT PATCH handlers use Updates so only fields the client
// actually sent get written. The ReplaceT PUT handlers use Save so
// every column on the bound row lands, including fields the caller
// cleared. DeleteT handlers also use Updates to write only the
// reconciliation flag columns (DeletionScheduled, etc.) without
// touching the rest of the row. GORM fires the Update hooks from
// whatever call shape the caller used.
//
// The hook column shows which generated hooks each call fires. CreateT
// and ReplaceT reach different GORM methods (Create and Save) but
// present the same full-object shape, so they are easy to conflate;
// the shared shape, not a shared method, is what misleads. DeleteT is
// two-phase for reconciled types: the first call schedules deletion
// through Updates and fires the Update hooks, then once the controller
// confirms, the final call soft deletes and fires the Delete hooks.
// That soft delete writes deleted_at with an UPDATE, but GORM keys
// hooks on the operation, so it runs the Delete hooks, not the Update
// hooks.
//
// Under the hood the two call shapes differ in what the hook receiver
// holds. The examples use loaded (a row pulled from the DB), patch
// (the caller's partial payload), and obj (a complete inbound row).
//
//   - Model(&loaded).Updates(&patch): the caller has a payload with
//     only the fields it wants to change; GORM applies those over the
//     loaded row and leaves the rest. Hook receiver is the loaded DB
//     row; the caller's new values live in tx.Statement.Dest.
//
//   - Save(&obj): the caller has a complete object and wants every
//     field persisted. Receiver and tx.Statement.Dest are the same
//     inbound object that already holds the new values.
//
// Create uses the Create method but the Save shape: receiver, Model,
// and Dest all point at the inbound object.
//
// Updates fire from either shape. GORM merges the incoming values
// onto the receiver between the before-update and after-update
// callbacks, so by an after-update hook the receiver already reflects
// the committed result.
//
// To stay correct regardless of shape, hooks read through helpers
// rather than the receiver directly. IsFieldChanged is the high-level
// helper to reach for first; the rest are lower-level building blocks:
//
//   - IsFieldChanged for per-field change detection (works under both
//     PATCH and PUT; handles the DB load internally).
//   - IncomingValues(tx) for the values being written.
//   - LoadObjectFromDB(tx) for a fresh read of the committed row.
//   - IsFullReplace to identify the Save-shape call (PUT) where a nil
//     inbound field means an explicit clear.
//   - IsPartialUpdate to identify the Updates-shape call (PATCH and
//     DELETE) where a nil inbound field means absent-and-unchanged.
//
// Layer choice for the PUT/PATCH naming
//
// The helpers name the distinction at the semantic layer (IsFullReplace
// / IsPartialUpdate). It could have been named at any of three other
// layers:
//
//   layer             | true on PUT   | true on PATCH or DELETE | DELETE caveat
//   ------------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------
//   GORM method       | IsSave        | IsUpdates               | no
//   semantic (chosen) | IsFullReplace | IsPartialUpdate         | no
//   HTTP verb         | IsPut         | IsPatch                 | yes
//   threeport client  | IsReplace     | IsUpdate                | yes
//
// The alternatives, and why each was passed over:
//
//   - HTTP verb (IsPatch) and threeport client (IsUpdate) read DELETE
//     and DeleteT, neither PATCH nor UpdateT, so they answer false and
//     miss a genuinely partial call. That false answer is the DELETE
//     caveat.
//   - GORM method (IsUpdates) is correct and carries no caveat, but it
//     names the mechanism (Save versus Updates) rather than the intent.
//
// The semantic layer carries no caveat and names the call shape
// directly, without HTTP, client, or GORM-method vocabulary, so the
// helpers use it.

// IsFieldChanged reports whether the named field is being modified by
// the current GORM update. Reach for this first for any per-field
// change detection in a hook; it works under both PATCH and PUT call
// shapes.
//
// Under PATCH (Updates), uses tx.Statement.Changed which correctly
// compares the inbound patch against the loaded row (no DB read).
// Under PUT (Save), loads the committed row via LoadObjectFromDB and
// compares the named field by reflection, one DB read per call.
//
// Returns an error if the named field doesn't exist on the type, the
// row has no ID, or the DB load fails. Callers in immutability hooks
// should return the error so GORM aborts the transaction rather than
// proceeding with an undetermined change status.
